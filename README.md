# changepoint-nhpp

R codes to compute changepoints on a sequence of nonhomogeneous Poisson processes. The method is described in the paper 
*Changepoint detection on daily home activity pattern: a sliced Poisson process method* and can be found here

example.R provides illustrate how to use the PELT.tpp.R using simulated data. 

PELT.tpp.R is the function that computes changepoints.
